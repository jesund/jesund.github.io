I am currently a second-year PhD Student in Machine Learning and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Broadly, I am interested in developing methodologies that help policymakers make better decisions using data. More specifically, I am interested in causal machine learning and  improving machine learning methods for tabular data. 

Prior to CMU, I worked in the social sector for eight years, including over four working for non-profits in East Africa.  Many of my research interests are borne out of challenges I encountered while working with data to improve decision-making in industry.
